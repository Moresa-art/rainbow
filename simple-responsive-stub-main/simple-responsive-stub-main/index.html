        <p>Let us check other interesting facts about rainbow: The arc of the rainbow has violet tone for the inner areas. On the other hand, the outer side features the red tone. A double rainbow may occur too. The inner part of the arc features the red hue. The primary arc is seen inside the second arc. Rainbow is an optical illusion.</p>

        <p>A multi-colored arc that we see in the sky is a rainbow. It is not an object but an optical phenomenon. You cannot touch it or feel it as it has no physical existence. It is made up of light that reflects and bend. You can never reach at the end of a rainbow as it moves along with the view and does not have a static or stationary position in the sky.</p>

            The word “Rainbow” is derived from the Latin word “arcus pluvius,” which refers to a “rainy arch.” It is called rainbow because its shape looks like an archer’s bow. It is the universal symbol of peace and harmony and also renewed hope.</p>

            A rainbow arch becomes visible to a person when the light gets refracted at a precise 42 degrees angle in the opposite direction of the Sun. This refraction of light at this angle is the major reason that we can see the seven bands of white light with our naked eyes. When the position of the Sun is lower, the rainbow will be seen at a higher location in the sky.
